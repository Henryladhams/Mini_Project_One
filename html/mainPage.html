                <p>Welcome to Easy Strength Trainer!  For all new gym goers who are looking to start training without an expensive personal trainer session
                    <br>or for those who are looking to get back into the gym without an 
                    app that forces you into a subscription, this is just the website you need.</br>
                    This website is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use tool for anyone looking to get started or get back into the gym, who wants to increase their strength.    
                </p>
                <br>
            </br>
                <p>The three tabs below are the three days per week you need to train to increase your full body strength.<br>
                    Each day targets different muscle groups and has descriptions for your training routine for each day.</br>
                    Start from left to right for the best experience, or if you wish to only train one of the routines that is fine, they are designed to fit in<br>
                    with any other normal workout routine you may have planned regardless.</br>
                </p>
